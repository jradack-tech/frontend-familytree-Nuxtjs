## Description

Browser based genealogy software for interacting and processing data efficiently. Easily create your
own family tree by importing your existing data or manual data entry. Storage of all data is securely on your own server and does
not leave your environment without your permission. In the future there will be optional
smart matching with other servers. This is the Nuxt and Vue frontend, see the backend repository for the Laravel 8 backend API support.
